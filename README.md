This is a web-based Matrix Calculator application built using Python, Flask, and SQLite that allows users to perform basic matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Users can input two matrices through a simple web interface, and the app processes and displays the result instantly. It includes input validation to ensure matrix dimensions are compatible for each operation and stores previous calculations using a lightweight SQLite database. The project is ideal for demonstrating practical use of Flask for backend development, form handling, and database integration in a mathematical tool.
